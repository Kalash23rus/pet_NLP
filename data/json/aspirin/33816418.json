This retrospective cohort study used records from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database of claims made between 1997 and 2013. After propensity score matching (PSM), patients who took a low dose of aspirin for more than 90 days within 1 year of diagnosis with CCVDs were identified as the exposure group (n = 15,784). A matched total of 15,784 individuals without aspirin use were selected for the non-aspirin group. The main outcome was the development of pneumonia after the index date. Multivariable Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and cumulative probability of pneumonia. The result after PSM indicated a lower hazard ratio for pneumonia in aspirin users (aHR = 0.890, 95% confidence interval = 0.837-0.945). Therefore, patients with CCVDs who took aspirin had a lower risk of developing pneumonia than those who did not. In conclusion, this population-based cohort study demonstrated that long-term low-dose aspirin use is associated with a slightly decreased risk of pneumonia in patients with CCVDs.", "JT": "Frontiers in public health", "FAU": ["Chen, Ying-Cheng", "Chen, Yin-Yang", "Yeh, Han Wei", "Yeh, Tung-Ying", "Huang, Jing-Yang", "Liao, Pei-Lun", "Yeh, Liang-Tsai", "Yang, Shun-Fa", "Chou, Ming-Chih", "Yeh, Chao-Bin"]}
