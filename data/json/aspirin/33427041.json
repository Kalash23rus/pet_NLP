The estimated lifetime risk of the disease is about 5% with an incidence of one million new cases and 600,000 deaths worldwide every year. It is estimated that in 2019, approximately 134,490 new cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed with 49,190 mortalities. Though the disease is regarded as a disorder of the more developed world, the occurrence is steadily increasing in many developing countries. Since chronic inflammation is a known aggravating risk factor for colorectal cancer, anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin have been used to prevent the development of colorectal cancer and related mortality. The potential mechanisms for the effect of aspirin in the prevention of colorectal cancer have been proposed and broadly classified as cyclooxygenase (COX) dependent and COX-independent. Some of the primary effectors of COX-dependent mechanisms in carcinogenesis are likely to be prostaglandins. In contrast to the reversible action of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin is known to irreversibly inactivate COX enzymes to suppress production of prostaglandins. COX-independent mechanisms of anticancer effects of aspirin include down-regulation of nuclear factor kappa B activity and Akt activation, modulation of Bcl-2 and Bax family proteins, suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor, induction of apoptosis, disruption of DNA repair mechanisms, and induction of spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase that modulates polyamine catabolism.", "JT": "Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners", "FAU": ["Belayneh, Yaschilal Muche", "Amare, Gedefew Getnet", "Meharie, Birhanu Geta"]}
