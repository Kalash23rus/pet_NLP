{"PMID": "33657423", "TI": "Mechanisms of the antiangiogenic effects of aspirin in cancer.", "AB": "Aspirin is an old drug extracted from willow bark and is widely used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Accumulating evidence has shown that aspirin use may significantly reduce the angiogenesis of cancer; however, the mechanism of the association between angiogenesis and aspirin is complex. Although COX-1 is widely known as a target of aspirin, several studies reveal other antiangiogenic targets of aspirin, such as angiotensin II, glucose transporter 1, heparanase, and matrix metalloproteinase. In addition, some data indicates that aspirin may produce antiangiogenic effects after acting in different cell types, such as endothelial cells, platelets, pericytes, and macrophages. In this review, we concentrate on research regarding the antiangiogenic effects of aspirin in cancer, and we discuss the molecular mechanisms of aspirin and its metabolites. Moreover, we discuss some mechanisms through which aspirin treatment may normalize existing blood vessels, including preventing the disintegration of endothelial adheres junctions and the recruitment of pericytes. We also address the antiangiogenic effects and the underlying mechanisms of aspirin derivatives, which are aimed at improving safety and efficacy.", "JT": "European journal of pharmacology", "FAU": ["Xie, Shiyuan", "Wang, Youqiong", "Huang, Yixuan", "Yang, Bin"]}
