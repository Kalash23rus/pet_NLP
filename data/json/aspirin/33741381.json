Thus, discovering and developing novel therapeutics for gastric cancer has become a global priority. In this study, we synthesized two novel anthraquinone-based aspirin derivatives, Asp-X3 and Asp-X3-CH3, with therapeutic potential for gastric cancer. The structures of the two compounds were determined by 1D, 2D-NMR, and High-Resolution Mass (HRSM). Asp-X3 and Asp-X3-CH3 could inhibit the growth of gastric cancer cells (SGC7901), yielding IC50 values 10-fold lower than that of Aspirin. Asp-X3 and Asp-X3-CH3 were less toxic to gastric mucosal cells, yielding IC50 values that were about 2-fold higher than the corresponding IC50 values determined with SGC7901 cells. Asp-X3-CH3 and Asp-X3 also induced SGC7901 cells to undergo apoptosis, yielding apoptotic rates that were about twice the rate induced by Aspirin. Asp-X3-CH3 did not cause significant loss of COX-1 expression in gastric mucosal cells, whereas Asp-X3 and Aspirin both caused significant loss of COX-1 expression as demonstrated by Western blot, consistent with their effects on the content of PGE2 in these cells as determined by ELISA assay. However, both Asp-X3-CH3 and Asp-X3 exerted a similar effect on the level of COX-2 in gastric cancer cells, causing as much as 90% and 95% reduction in COX-2 expression, respectively. Taken together, the results suggested that Asp-X3-CH3 and Asp-X3 were potentially better agents than Aspirin for the inhibition of gastric cancer cell growth, but Asp-X3-CH3 was more effective.", "JT": "European journal of pharmacology", "FAU": ["Lin, Shan", "Zhang, Yue", "Wang, Zeyu", "Zhang, Shuang", "Li, Yingjie", "Fan, Yuhua", "Li, Dan", "Li, Sen", "Bai, Yuhua"]}
